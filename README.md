# derya-bot
pixel deryada hiç roleback ve pikseli koruma olmasaydı?

Ultimate utility bot made for PixelYa. Uses **Discord.JS v13** almost entirely. The code probably still has a lot of flaws and bugs (that I didn't notice since I made the bot specifically for **TRZN**'s use), and I don't know how it would adapt to other servers. But it gets the job done.

```\> npm install``` command should download almost all of the dependencies when ran on the same directory as the ```bot.js``` file. Except for the ones that Python needs. You'll have to download them manually. I can't remember the full list, but **Pillow** was definitely one of them.

The code is probably still pretty messy since I started working on it as a little project rather than a complex tool that it has become. I didn't even know the basics of **JavaScript** when I started working on the project.
